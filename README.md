Hi, I'm Anggih. Student of RevoU FSSE Madrid 2023.

I'm a mathematics lover that wish to develop myself using this ability that I love the most to be the next Software Engineer.

My career right now is as Customer Service English at Start Up Financial Singapore Company, It's called Payfazz StraitsX. 

I am a person who really values friendship. My friends have careers in various fields, and my college friends was choosing Software Engineer as their career. I thought I also wanted to get into that career, but I needed a teacher who could help direct me towards that goal.

I was late to be there, but I believe it's never too late to learn as long as there is a desire.

I hope my brother, Lindo, will proud of me.
